    #statement will interfere with the operation of the grader. Instead,
    #use the logging module, which we've configured to log to a file printed
    #when you click "Test Run". For example:
    #logging.info("My debugging message")
    #
    #Note that, unlike print, logging.info will take only a single argument.
    #So logging.info("my message") will work, but logging.info("my","message") will not.
